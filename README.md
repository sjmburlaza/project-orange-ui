# Project Orange UI

Project Orange UI is an Angular storefront and admin workspace for a multi-country commerce experience. It includes site-aware routing, product listing and detail pages, wishlist saves, cart and checkout flows with localized payment methods, guest order lookup, order confirmation and history, add-on experiences, authentication, profile pages, and a standalone admin app for analytics, order management, and product management. The project is covered by unit and Playwright end-to-end tests, with CI running lint, unit tests, e2e tests, and production builds.

## Tech Stack

- Angular 20 with standalone components and lazy routes
- Angular SSR/server output with client hydration
- Angular Material, Angular CDK, SCSS, and Bootstrap Icons
- npm workspaces with buildable `@orange/*` Angular libraries
- NgRx Store, Effects, and Store DevTools for products, cart, and trade-in state
- ngx-translate with split translation resources
- Vitest through Angular's unit test builder
- Playwright for end-to-end tests

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:4200/`. The dev server uses `proxy.conf.cjs` to forward `/api` requests to `http://localhost:5175`. Analytics requests prefer the json-server mock on `http://localhost:5176` when it is running, and fall back to `http://localhost:5175` otherwise.

For the local analytics dashboard mock, run this in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run mock:api
```

To enter the storefront, choose a country from the root page or visit a site-scoped route directly:

```text
http://localhost:4200/ph/products
http://localhost:4200/fr/products
http://localhost:4200/cn/products
http://localhost:4200/jp/products
```

Run the standalone admin app when working on analytics, order management, or product management:

```bash
npm run ng -- serve project-orange-admin
```

The admin app runs from `projects/admin/src/app` and currently owns:

```text
/analytics
/orders
/products
```

## Application Flow

The root route (`/`) loads the country entry screen. It uses `/api/sites` and `/api/geo/country` to list supported sites and suggest a country when possible. The selected site is saved in local storage under `orange.sitePreference`.

For detailed analytics dashboard documentation, see [Dashboard Analytics](projects/admin/src/app/pages/analytics/README.md). The dashboard now lives in the standalone admin app under `projects/admin/src/app/pages/analytics`.

Most app routes are scoped by site:

| Route                                  | Purpose                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/:site/products`                      | Product listing with category, sort, price filters, and save toggles.                            |
| `/:site/products/:productId`           | Product detail page.                                                                             |
| `/:site/products/:productId/configure` | Product configurator and add-to-cart flow.                                                       |
| `/:site/cart`                          | Cart review, quantity updates, vouchers, shipping, and add-ons.                                  |
| `/:site/checkout`                      | Dynamic checkout form, shipping, site-aware payments, draft persistence, and order summary flow. |
| `/:site/auth/login`                    | Sign in.                                                                                         |
| `/:site/auth/register`                 | Account registration.                                                                            |
| `/:site/auth/forgot-password`          | Password reset entry point.                                                                      |
| `/:site/auth/reset-password`           | Complete password reset with email and token.                                                    |
| `/:site/orders`                        | Guest order lookup or signed-in order history.                                                   |
| `/:site/orders/my-orders`              | Orders route alias for lookup and history.                                                       |
| `/:site/orders/confirmation/:orderId`  | Order confirmation page after checkout.                                                          |
| `/:site/profile/account-settings`      | Customer account settings.                                                                       |
| `/:site/profile/wishlist`              | Authenticated customer wishlist with saved products.                                             |

Unsupported site codes are redirected back to the country selector.

The standalone admin app owns admin pages outside the site-scoped storefront route tree:

| Route        | Purpose                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `/analytics` | Admin analytics dashboard. |
| `/orders`    | Admin order management.    |
| `/products`  | Admin product management.  |

## API Behavior

All API calls start with `/api`. During local development, `proxy.conf.cjs` forwards most requests to `http://localhost:5175`; analytics dashboard and analytics event routes prefer the json-server mock at `http://localhost:5176` and fall back to `http://localhost:5175` when the mock is not running.

`ApiSitePrefixInterceptor` automatically prefixes scoped API calls with the active site code. For example, a component that requests:

```text
/api/products
```

while the active route is `/ph/products` is sent as:

```text
/api/ph/products
```

The interceptor leaves these unscoped endpoints unchanged:

```text
/api/sites
/api/sites/:site
/api/geo/country
/api/payments/intents
/api/payments/confirm
```

Primary API areas used by the UI:

| Area              | Endpoints                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Auth requests use credentials and XSRF support. `AuthInterceptor` adds `withCredentials` to API requests and redirects unauthenticated users to the site login page when protected requests return `401`.

Wishlist routes require an authenticated session and are scoped to the active site by the site-prefix interceptor. Product cards expose a bookmark save toggle; unauthenticated users see the shared confirmation dialog before being sent to login with the current URL preserved as `returnUrl`.

## Checkout and Payments

Checkout uses `/api/checkout/form` for dynamic steps, saves drafts under `checkoutData`, and supports schema-provided payment methods through unscoped `/api/payments/intents` and `/api/payments/confirm` endpoints.

## Mock Auth

Mock auth is available through `MockAuthInterceptor`, but it is disabled by default. To enable it for local work, set `useMockAuth` to `true` in the active environment file:

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  useMockAuth: true,
};
```

The mock interceptor handles:

- `GET /api/geo/country`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password`
- `GET /api/auth/session`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`

The default mock user is an admin user with broad product, inventory, order, and user permissions.

## Mock Payments

`MockPaymentInterceptor` is enabled locally and in staging; card and GCash values ending in `0000` fail, `9999` stays pending, and offline methods return pending instructions.

## State Management

Global feature state is registered in `projects/storefront/src/app/app.config.ts`:

- `productFeature` and `ProductEffects` for catalog loading and filters
- `cartFeature` and `CartEffects` for cart, vouchers, shipping, and add-ons
- `tradeInFeature` and `TradeInEffects` for trade-in configuration and sessions

Feature facades sit beside their stores and are the preferred integration point for components. Wishlist state is kept in `WishlistService` because it is a small authenticated user collection shared by product cards and the profile wishlist page.

## Localization and Sites

Translations live in `projects/storefront/src/assets/i18n/<language>/`. The current resources are:

```text
common.json
home.json
products.json
cart.json
wishlist.json
orders.json
checkout.json
auth.json
support.json
```

`MultiTranslateLoader` loads and merges those resources for the active language. Current language folders are:

```text
en
fr
zh
ja
```

Site configuration is loaded from the backend through `SiteService`. Each site includes:

- `code`
- `countryName`
- `locale`
- `currency`
- `defaultLanguage`
- `supportedLanguages`
- `features`

Feature flags currently affect add-ons such as insurance, trade-in, and vouchers.

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

Run Playwright e2e tests:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

The Playwright configuration starts the app automatically with:

```bash
npm run start:e2e -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4200
```

The e2e suite mocks the Orange API in `e2e/app.spec.ts` and uses fixture data from `e2e/fixtures/catalog.ts`, so a backend is not required for e2e tests.

If Playwright browsers are missing, install Chromium:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```
